The study "Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms" seeks to investigate the 
use of various machine learning algorithms in predicting the risk of stroke incidence. The 
study made use of a dataset that included patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle 
variables, and health indicators including blood pressure and glucose level.
To determine the best-performing method for stroke prediction, numerous machine learning 
techniques are used, including logistic regression, decision trees, XG Boost and KNN and 
Ensemble learning techniques like Max Voting and Averaging. The algorithms were 
evaluated using several measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
According to the study's findings, the XG Boost algorithm outperforms all others in stroke 
prediction, with an accuracy of 94% and F1 score of 0.94. Age, hypertension, diabetes, 
smoking status, and prior stroke history were also revealed as significant predictors of stroke 
in the research.
Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms for stroke 
prediction and sheds light on the significance of various patient demographics, medical 
history, and lifestyle variables in predicting stroke incidence. The study's findings may help 
to build more accurate stroke prediction models and assist healthcare practitioners in 
identifying persons at high risk of stroke for prompt intervention and prevention.
